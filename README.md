# ublox M8

This is the ROS driver changed form [KumarRobotics/ublox](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/ublox) to adapt the new NEO-M8 serial, especially t out put the raw data form "RAWX" message. The following is the original README but **No Longer** applied. All the options has been moved to t he `*.yaml` file under `/ublox_gps/config`. This version now is buggy and tatty, not all the UBX messages are included. Till now we have new messages including:
- UBX-RXM-RAWX
- UBX-RXM-SFRBX
- UBX-NAV-ORB

Below is the original readme.
---------------------------
# ublox
The ublox package provides support for [u-blox](http://www.u-blox.com) GPS receivers. Only the _serial_ configuration of the driver is documented here, but TCP communication is also supported by the driver (untested).

The driver was originally written by Johannes Meyer. Changes made later are detailed in the version history below.

## Options

The `ublox_gps` node supports the following parameters:
* `device`: Path to the device in `/dev`. Defaults to `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
* `baudrate`: Bit rate of the serial communication. Defaults to 9600.
* `ublox_version`: Version of device: 6,7 or 8. Defaults to 6. Please consult known issues section.
* `frame_id`: ROS name prepended to frames produced by the node. Defaults to `gps`.
* `rate`: Rate in Hz of measurements. Defaults to 4.
* `enable_sbas`: Enable satellite-based augmentation system. Defaults to false.
* `enable_glonass`: Enable GLONASS receiver. Defaults to false.
* `enable_beidou`: Enable BeiDou receiver. Defaults to false.
* `enable_ppp`: Enable precise-point-positioning system. Defaults to false.
* `dynamic_model`: See U-blox protocol spec. Defaults to `portable`.
* `fix_mode`: Type of fixes supported: `2d`, `3d` or `both`.
* `dr_limit`: Max time in seconds to use dead reckoning after signal is lost. Defaults to 0. (Untested as of 28/08/2014).

## Topics

`~fix`([sensor_msgs/NavSatFix](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/NavSatFix.html))

Navigation Satellite fix.

`~fix_velocity`([geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovarianceStamped](http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/TwistWithCovarianceStamped.html))

Velocity in local ENU frame.

## Launch

A sample launch file is provided in `ublox_gps.launch`. The two topics to which you should subscribe are `/gps/fix` and `/gps/fix_velocity`. The angular component of `fix_velocity` is unused.

# Version history

* **0.0.5**:
  - Reformat files under `ublox_gps`

* **0.0.4**:
  - Added install targets.

* **0.0.3**:
  - Added the `enable_glonass`, `enable_beidou` and `enable_ppp` options.
  - Added the `ublox_version` option. Consult known issues for important details.
  - Added `numSVs` field to the RQT monitor.

* **0.0.2**:
  - Changed `meas_rate` to simply `rate`, which is in Hz. `meas_rate` is computed automatically.

* **0.0.1**:
  - All topics are now published on a private node handle.
  - Velocities are published as stamped twist messages with covariance. Angular components are unused.
  - `hAcc`, `vAcc` and `sAcc` are used to generate diagonal covariances.
  - Velocities use the correct convention: X-Y-Z = East-North-Up.
  - 2D **or** 3D fix correspond to `STATUS_FIX` (previously only 3D).
  - `fix` and `fix_velocity` are time-stamped synchronously, using the `iTOW` to check arrival times.
  - Added options for changing the CFG-NAV5 settings (see above).
  - Added support for `diagnostic_updater`.
  - _"received ACK"_ messages are elevated to debug level 2.
  - Corrected issue where baudrate was not set correctly using rosparam.
  - Corrected issue where socket destructors were not called.

* **0.0.0**:
  - Forked from https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/ublox
  - Updated to use catkin.

## Known Issues

### Note on `ublox_version`:

`ublox_version` is included as a temporary workaround, resulting from the problem that the ROS serializer cannot properly parse _all_ the ublox packets (particularly those with dynamic arrays). It is presently difficult to read the supported features of each device.

Consequently, the user should specify the version of their device in rosparam.

- Version <= 6: `enable_glonass`, `enable_beidou` are both ignored.
- Version == 7: `enable_beidou` is ignored.
- Version >= 8: Both options are supported.

A warning will be issued on the console indicating which options have been ignored.

## FAQs

1. The ublox_gps node cannot open my device, even though I have correctly specified the path in `/dev` - why? Make sure you are the owner of the device, or a member of `dialout` group.
