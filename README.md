# ublox
The `ublox` package provides support for [u-blox](http://www.u-blox.com) GPS receivers. Only the _serial_ configuration of the driver is documented here, but TCP communication is also supported by the driver (untested).

The driver was originally written by Johannes Meyer. Changes made later are detailed in the version history below.

## Options

# Version history

* **1.1.2**:
  - BUG FIX for NavSatFix messages for firmware >=7. The NavSatFix now only uses the NavPVT message time if it is valid, otherwise it uses ROS time.
  - BUG FIX for TMODE3 Fixed mode configuration. The ARP High Precision position is now configured correctly. 
  - BUG FIX for `NavDGPS` message which had the wrong Message ID.
  - After GNSS configuration & reset, I/O resets automatically, without need for restart.
  - Added `UBX-UPD` messages. For firmware version 8, the node can now save the flash memory on shutdown and clear the flash memory during configuration based on ROS params.
  - Added `CfgGPS` message and `MonHW6` message for firmware version 6.
  - Added respawn parameters to example launch file.
  - Added parameters to load/save configuration.
  - Added raw_data parameter for Raw Data Products.
  - Changed name of "subscribe" parameter namespace to "publish" for clarity.
  - Migrated all callback handling to `callback.h` from `gps.h` and `gps.cpp`. ACK messages are now processed through callback handlers.
  - Modified how the I/O stream is initialized so that the node now handles parsing the port string.
  - Changed class names of Ublox product components (e.g. UbloxTim -> TimProduct) for clarity.
  - Cleaned up ublox custom serialization classes by adding typedefs and using count to determine repeating block statements instead of using try-catch statements to serialize stream.
  - Added doxygen documentation
* **1.1.1**:
  - BUG FIX for acknowledgments. The last received ack message was accessed by multiple threads but was not atomic. This variable is now thread safe.
  - BUG FIX for GNSS configuration for Firmware 8, the GNSS configuration is now verified & modified properly.
  - BUG FIX for fix diagnostics. NumSV was displaying incorrectly. For firmware versions >=7, the NavPVT flags variable is now compared to the constants from the NavPVT message not NavSOL.
  - Removed ublox_version param, value is now determined by parsing MonVER.
  - Organized parameters into namespaces.
  - Better parameter checking. Checks that unsigned ints and vectors of unsigned ints are in bounds.
  - Changed rtcm/rate parameter to a vector instead of a scalar, now each RTCM id can be set to a different rate.
  - Diagnostic variables are displayed more clearly with units included. 
  - For HPG Rovers, added diagnostic updater for Carrier Phase Solution.
  - Added CfgNMEA messages for each firmware version and a CfgDAT message, as well as parameters to configure the NMEA and Datum.
  - Added constants for NavSAT_SV flags bit mask.

* **1.1.0**:
  - BUG FIX for NAV-PVT messages for firmware 7. The NAV-PVT message is shorter for firmware version 7, the new message is `NavPVT7`
  - BUG FIX for SBAS configuration, it now configures SBAS only if the device is SBAS capable. Previously, if enable_sbas was set to false, it would not configure, meaning that SBAS could not be turned off.
  - BUG FIX, the baudrate of the serial I/O port was not configured correctly, on the device it was set to the user desired settings, but on the computer it was always set to 4800.
  - BUG FIX, Diagnostics for Nav Status are now updated in firmware version 6.
  - BUG FIX, The method which waited for ACKs now checks if the ACK is from the correct class and message ID.
  - Added messages for `CfgTMODE3`, `CfgHNR`, `CfgRST`, `CfgINF`, `NavATT`, `ESF` messages, `Inf` message (for all INF types), `HnrPVT`, `MgaGAL`, `NavSAT`, `MonHw`, `NavPVT7` (for firmware version 7).
  - Restructured Node class so that it now uses composition. The main node contains instances of classes which implement `UBloxInterface`, and calls the methods for each interface added to the node. The classes which implement the interface add new features that are not generic to all firmware versions or products. Each firmware version (6-8) has an interface, and each product category has one (SPG, HPG REF, HPG ROV, TIM, FTS, ADR/UDR). The product type is determined from parsing the `MonVER` message.
  - Added implementations of `ComponentInterface` called `UbloxHpgRef` and `UbloxHpgRov` for HPG reference station and rover devices. The reference station tmode3 can be configured upon startup (see Options section) and the rover dgnss mode can be set. After survey in, once the reference station entire time mode, the nav_rate is set to the user desired value (it must be 1 Hz during survey-in) and the RTCM output messages are enabled. The state can be monitored through the rqt_runtime_monitor. These classes were tested on C94-M8P devices.
  - Added an implementation of `ComponentInterface` called `UbloxAdrUdr` for ADR/UDR devices. It which subscribes to `NavATT` and ESF messages and configures useAdr. The diagnostics monitor specific to these devices is not implemented. This class has not been tested on a hardware device.
  - Added a partial implementation of `UbloxTim` for TIM devices which subscribes to `RxmRAWX` and `RxmSFRBX` messages. The `getRosParams()`, `configureUblox()`, and `initializeDiagnostics()` methods are unimplemented.
  - Added a skeleton class for `UbloxFts` for FTS devices which is unimplemented. See the `ublox_gps` `node.cpp` and `node.h` files.
  - Changed how GNSS is configured in firmware version 8. The documentation recommends a cold restart after reconfiguring the GNSS, and will reset the device if it receives a `CfgGNSS` message, even if the settings do not change. For firmware version 8, before reconfiguring, the node first checks if the current GNSS settings are the same as the desired settings. If so, it will not send a CfgGNSS message to the device. After reconfiguring, it will cold reset the GNSS.
  - Migrated I/O initialization to the `Gps` class from the `Node` class.
  - INF messages are now printed to the ROS console.
  - Changed how debug statements are displayed. If the debug parameter is set to 1 or greater, it prints debug messages. 

* **1.0.0**:
  - Added messages for firmware 8: `NavPVT`, `RxmRAWX`, `RxmSFRBX`.
  - Modified ConfigGNSS and MonVER to include repeated blocks and added 
    ConfigGNSS_Block (configures all GNSS at once) and MonVER_Extension 
    (for MonVER_Char blocks).
  - MonVER info is now published upon initialization.
  - Fixed SBAS crashing issue (node crashed if device didn't have SBAS 
    capabilities)
  - Modified remaining messages to update to firmware 8
  - Added `UbloxNode` abstract class which does all previous node functions which 
    are the same for all firmware versions. Added subclasses which do functions
    specific to a given firmware version (e.g. subscribing to NavPVT messages).
  - Added a read lock to AsyncWorker
  - Removed hard-coded values from `Gps` and `Node` classes specific to a certain 
    device and changed them to configurable parameters. Modified example
    launch file accordingly.
  - Added example parameter yaml files and launch file to load parameters from
    this file.
  - Moved implementations of Callback functions into `callback.h` (from `gps.h` 
    and `gps.cpp`)
  - Updated formatting of some files per google style guide spec (e.g. 80 chars
    per line).

* **0.0.5**:
  - Reformat files under `ublox_gps`

* **0.0.4**:
  - Added install targets.

* **0.0.3**:
  - Added the `enable_glonass`, `enable_beidou` and `enable_ppp` options.
  - Added the `ublox_version` option. Consult known issues for important details.
  - Added `numSVs` field to the RQT monitor.

* **0.0.2**:
  - Changed `meas_rate` to simply `rate`, which is in Hz. `meas_rate` is computed automatically.

* **0.0.1**:
  - All topics are now published on a private node handle.
  - Velocities are published as stamped twist messages with covariance. Angular components are unused.
  - `hAcc`, `vAcc` and `sAcc` are used to generate diagonal covariances.
  - Velocities use the correct convention: X-Y-Z = East-North-Up.
  - 2D **or** 3D fix correspond to `STATUS_FIX` (previously only 3D).
  - `fix` and `fix_velocity` are time-stamped synchronously, using the `iTOW` to check arrival times.
  - Added options for changing the CFG-NAV5 settings (see above).
  - Added support for `diagnostic_updater`.
  - _"received ACK"_ messages are elevated to debug level 2.
  - Corrected issue where baudrate was not set correctly using rosparam.
  - Corrected issue where socket destructors were not called.

* **0.0.0**:
  - Forked from https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/ublox
  - Updated to use catkin.

# Adding new features
## Adding new messages
1. Create the .msg file and add it to `ublox_msgs/msg`. Make sure the file includes the constants `CLASS_ID` and `MESSAGE_ID`. 

2. Modify `ublox_msgs/include/ublox_msgs/ublox_msgs.h`. 
a. Include the message header. 
b. Make sure the message's class constant is declared in the `ublox_msgs::Class` namespace. 
c. Declare the message's ID constant in the `ublox_messages::Message::<CLASS_NAME>` namespace.

3. Declare the message in `ublox_msgs/src/ublox_msgs.cpp`. 

4. If the message has a repeated or optional block of varying size, create an additional message for the repeating block and include it in the message. 
a. Include the block message in the `ublox_msgs/include/ublox_msgs/ublox_msgs.h` file. 
b. Modify `ublox_msgs/include/ublox/serialization/ublox_msgs.h` and add a custom `Serializer`. If the message doesn't include the number of repeating/optional blocks as a parameter, you can infer it from the count/size of the message, which is the length of the payload.

5. Modify `ublox_gps/src/node.cpp` (and the header file if necessary) to either subscribe to the message or send the configuration message. Be sure to modify the appropriate subscribe function. For messages which apply to all firmware/hardware, modify `UbloxNode::subscribe()`. Otherwise modify the appropriate firmware or hardware's subscribe function, e.g. `UbloxFirmware8::subscribe()`, `HpgRovProduct::subscribe()`. If the message is a configuration message, consider modifying `ublox_gps/src/gps.cpp` (and the header file) to add a configuration function.

### One message protocol for multiple IDs (e.g. INF message)
If a given message protocol applies to multiple message IDs (e.g. the `Inf` message), do not include the message ID in the message itself.
When declaring the message, for the first declaration, use `DECLARE_UBLOX_MESSAGE` macro. For the following declarations use the `DECLARE_UBLOX_MESSAGE_ID` macro.

## Adding device / firmware specific functionality

The `node.cpp` file in `ublox_gps` contains a main Node class called UbloxNode which acts as the ROS Node and handles the node initialization, publishers, and diagnostics. `UbloxNode` contains a vector `components_` of instances of `ComponentInterface`. The `UbloxNode::initialize()` calls each component's public interface methods. The node contains components for both the firmware version and the product category, which are added after parsing the `MonVER` message. Any class which implements `ComponentInterface` can be added to the `UbloxNode` `components_` vector and its methods will be called by `UbloxNode`. Simply add an implementation of `ComponentInterface` to the ublox_gps `node.h` and `node.cpp` files. Behavior specific to a given firmware or product should not be implemented in the `UbloxNode` class and instead should be implemented in an implementation of `ComponentInterface`.

Currently there are implementations of `ComponentInterface` for firmware versions 6-8 and product categories `HpgRefProduct`, `HpgRovProduct`, `AdrUdrProduct`, `TimProduct`, `FtsProduct`.  SPG products do not have their own implementation of `ComponentInterface`, since the Firmware classes implement all of the behavior of SPG devices.

`HpgRefProduct` and `HpgRovProduct` have been tested on the C94-M8P device. 

## Adding new parameters
1. Modify the `getRosParams()` method in the appropriate implementation of ComponentInterface (e.g. UbloxNode, UbloxFirmware8, HpgRefProduct, etc.) and get the parameter. Group multiple related parameters into a namespace. Use all lower case names for parameters and namespaces separated with underscores. 
* If the type is an unsigned integer (of any size) or vector of unsigned integers, use the `ublox_node::getRosUint` method which will verify the bounds of the parameter.
* If the type is an int8 or int16 or vector of int8's or int16's, use the `ublox_nod::getRosInt` method which will verify the bounds of the parameter. (This method can also be used for int32's but ROS has methods to get int32 parameters as well).
2. If the parameter is used during configuration also modify the `ComponentInterface`'s `configureUblox()` method to send the appropriate configuration message. Do not send configuration messages in `getRosParams()`.
3. Modify this README file and add the parameter name and description in the appropriate section. State whether there is a default value or if the parameter is required.
4. Modify one of the sample `.yaml` configuration files in `ublox_gps/config` to include the parameter or add a new sample `.yaml` for your device.

# Known Issues

## Unimplemented / Untested Devices

`TimProduct` and `FtsProduct` are currently unimplemented skeleton classes. `AdrUdrProduct` is implemented, with the exception of `initializeRosDiagnostics()` and has not been tested on hardware. 

`UbloxFirmware7` has not been properly tested on a device with firmware version 7. `UbloxFirmware6` has been tested on a device with firmware version 8, but not with firmware version 6.

## Debugging

For debugging messages set the debug parameter to > 0. The range for debug is 0-4. At level 1 it prints configuration messages and checksum errors, at level 2 it also prints ACK/NACK messages and sent messages. At level 3 it prints the received bytes being decoded by a specific message reader. At level 4 it prints the incoming buffer before it is split by message header.

## Troubleshooting

1. Why can't the ublox_gps node open my device, even though I have correctly specified the path in `/dev`? 
* Make sure you are the owner of the device, or a member of `dialout` group.
